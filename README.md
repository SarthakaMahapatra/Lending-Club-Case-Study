# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending Club is a financial marketplace that specializes in offering various types of loans to urban customers. The primary challenge the company faces is minimizing financial losses from loans extended to applicants considered "risky." These credit losses primarily result from borrowers failing to repay their loans, also known as "charged-off" cases.

> The goal of this analysis is to identify key factors influencing loan defaults and to develop insights for better risk management and business decisions.

## General Information
Objective

>The objective of this project is to analyze Lending Club's dataset to identify key patterns and variables associated with loan defaults. This information will help the company make data-driven decisions to mitigate credit losses.

Background

>Lending Club processes a high volume of loan applications and faces two major challenges:

>>Approving loans for applicants likely to repay them, ensuring profitability.
>>
>>Identifying applicants at higher risk of default, to prevent financial losses.

This analysis leverages exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover actionable insights about applicants' loan behaviors and risk factors.

Dataset

>The dataset contains detailed information about borrowers, loan amounts, purposes, grades, income levels, and repayment histories.
